# Telephone Directory System
Based on the assignment questions given, it is concluded that there are four functional requirements needed to be implemented in the telephone directory system. These functions are searching, creating new queries, modifying existing queries, and printing lists. The non-functional requirements are to avoid duplicate entries.

The only operator for the system is Telephone Operator (TO). The data are APU staff's telephone number and the respective employee id, employee name, and department name. The telephone number can include extension number, personal phone number and house phone number. The assignment question asked to use employee id or name as the search key. Considering there may be staff with the same name or same extension number, the employee id is the unique id in this case and will be asked for double confirmation if there are duplicate employee's names or extension number.

In conclusion, a Telephone Directory System is designed to allow the telephone operator (TO) to perform functions. TO is able to search for employee telephone number, to create new employee entry using the system, update details of existing employees and produce a list of employees department-wise. This has fulfilled the assignment requirements. However, further updates to the program are still needed to make it fully functional. For example, UI interface, delete function and back up function could be implemented to this program in the future.
